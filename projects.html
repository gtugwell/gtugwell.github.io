                            This is the project I am most proud of! We designed a website from scratch for the Women In Nuclear Engineering TAMU chapter.
                            This website allows WIN (Women In Nuclear), to have all of their information, as well as allows users to login, and participate in 
                            events, tracking their participation throughout their semester, and then formatting all that information so the officers do not have to
                            manually enter participation data. It also allows them to display their officers, have a "facebook-esque" discussion board that
                            can be curated by organization officers, as well as show a calendar that can be edited by the officers.

                            This is one of the projects I am most proud of, the website is still active to this day, so feel free to try it out. This web application
                            allows you to log into different social media pages, in this case, facebook, reddit, and tumblr, and then view all of your feeds in one 
                            location. Additionally, you can post to multiple of those social media sites at once, and you can get an overall
                            view of analytics, such as your likes, and follwers. The intent was to create a web application used for people 
                            who use social media as part of their job.

                            This was a project we worked on in our first hackathon, which we actually won an award for.
                            This project utilized wolfram alphas programming language to overlay accidents on a map, which was intended to give users 
                            an insight so those driving could see information about where accidents happened more frequently. Unfortunantly the site is no longer
                            operational, however our devpost is still avaliable to view! Click on the title to vist the page!

                            This was a project we worked on in another hackathon. This project was made in the middle of COVID, so our
                            intention with this project was to create a website you could visit to plan a trip during COVID, which would
                            give you all of the relevant information concerning quarantining needs, and what was open, as well as give you some
                            current information on travel restrictions and general news pertaining to COVID.
